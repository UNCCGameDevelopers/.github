# 1. Be friendly, civil, and patient.

  - Professionalism is a value we uphold and ask others to respect. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.

  - We actively moderate our comments sections to promote healthy, productive, and educational discussion among our community.

  - Above all else, we reserve the right to delete user-submitted content that we deem offensive, spammy, off-topic, or otherwise inappropriate for our audience.

  - Our mods are knowledgeable volunteers and will address any issues or questions asap, please be patient.

# 2. Be welcoming and respectful.

  - Game Developers at UNC Charlotte welcomes and supports community members of all backgrounds and identities; after all, our own staff is made up of people from a wide range of backgrounds and identities.
  - 
# 3. When we disagree, try to understand why.

  - “There is a difference between discourse for the purpose of understanding, and discourse for the purpose of undermining” (quote attributed to @amandaseales).

  - Repeat offenders may be blocked entirely from participating in online discussions. Deliberately inflammatory comments from first-time commenters/non-members may earn an immediate ban.

  - It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. The game developer industry, arts & humanities, and computer science itself is made better thanks to people from a wide range of backgrounds, and this is even more true for our community.

  - Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on understanding each other and learning from mistakes.

# 4. Stay curious and help others learn and grow!

  - We value relational leadership and believe everyone in this organization can be leaders and develop the skills to collaborate, share, teach, and learn from others through inclusive, purposeful, and empowering collaboration.

  - There's a wide variety of people with different skill sets in our organization at different levels. We encourage our community to actively work together to answer questions and help each other out!
 
# 5. Have Fun! :)
